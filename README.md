# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a browser-based sketching app that mimics the classic toy Etch-a-Sketch. You can use your mouse to draw on a grid of squares, and change the color and size of your brush. You can also erase your drawing and start over with a blank canvas.

## Features

- A 16x16 grid of square divs that change color when you hover over them.
- A button that prompts you to enter a new grid size and generates a new grid accordingly.
- A color picker that lets you choose the color of your brush.
- A slider that lets you adjust the opacity of your brush.
- A toggle button that switches between rainbow mode and normal mode. In rainbow mode, your brush changes color randomly as you draw.
- A clear button that resets the grid to its original state.

## Technologies

This project was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It used the following web development tools:

- [Flexbox] for creating a responsive layout.
- [CSSmatic] for generating box-shadow styles for the buttons.
- [Color Picker] for selecting colors interactively.
